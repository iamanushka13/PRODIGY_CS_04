## Keylogger Project (Educational Use Only)

This is a simple **Python keylogger** made using `pynput`.  
It records keystrokes and saves them to a text file (`keylog.txt`).

⚠️ **Disclaimer:** This project is for **educational purposes only**.  
Do not use it on any system without permission — doing so is illegal and unethical.

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pynput
2. Run the script:
   python keylogger.py
3. Press keys and thus, logs will be saved in keylog.txt.
4. Stop the program with Ctrl + C.

## Sample Output
hello [Key.space] world
